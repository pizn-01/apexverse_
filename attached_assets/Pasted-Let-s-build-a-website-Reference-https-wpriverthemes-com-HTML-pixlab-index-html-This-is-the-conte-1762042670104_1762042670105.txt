(2). ABOUT US
Mark and Birdie have worked on multiple projects together, and through their mutual love for content, artwork, and overall client services, ApexVerse was born! No project is too big or too small for us. We want to help everyone, from the debut indie authors just getting started all the way to experienced authors just wanting a break so they can focus on their writing.
Birdie released her debut novel in August 2025. Through self-publishing, she learned a lot about what it takes to get a book on the market. She understands how time-consuming all the extras can be that come with promoting books. Birdie is organized and wants to see every author succeed. So whether you’re just starting and have no clue where to even start, or you're a seasoned author who just needs help managing that email inbox and social media posting, Birdie’s your girl.
Mark is a seasoned illustrator and really captures the image you’re looking for. He has years of experience creating beautiful character art scenes, as well as graphics for websites, animations for book trailers, and everything in between. Mark truly succeeds in making your vision come to life and always makes sure his work is clean and to your liking!
We want to ensure that every client is satisfied with our work. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions you may have! We really look forward to working with you on any project, large or small.
(3). OUR SERVICES
We offer an array of services. A La Carte is geared more for authors wanting to dip their toes in, or authors who are already handling many of these aspects but just need some help on a few select things.
Our Packages are curated to encompass the broad needs of authors getting their books out there. These are perfect for debut indie authors!
Our Full Service Contract is for any author starting out who doesn’t want to have to stress about the little things, or seasoned authors who just want to focus on writing.
The goal of our services is to serve YOU, the Author, in any way that we can. Let us help ease the stress of the details so you can focus on what you do best, writing!

The website should guide visitors from service discovery through purchase decision with intuitive navigation and clear calls-to-action.
